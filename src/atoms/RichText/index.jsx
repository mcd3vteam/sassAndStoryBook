      Because so few physicians have experience with salivary gland cancer,
      it&rsquo;s important&nbsp;to be treated by an oncologist who specializes
      in head and neck cancers and is knowledgeable about this disease.

    <h2>Diagnosing and Treating Salivary Gland Cancer</h2>
    <p>
      Despite its rarity, there are many types of salivary gland cancers and a
      broad spectrum of tumor types, including benign tumors and&nbsp;low-risk
      cancers, as well as more aggressive cancers that have a high chance of
      spreading to the lymph nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A diagnosis is often made when patients notice a lump or swelling in the
      mouth, cheek, jaw, or neck, especially one that begins to enlarge or cause
      pain or numbness. An oncologist can perform a physical exam and may use
      imagining tests, such as MRI or CT technology, or a biopsy to determine
      whether a tumor is cancerous and, if so, to determine the stage of the
      cancer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salivary gland cancers are most often treated with surgery first and,
      depending on the type of tumor, sometimes followed with radiation and
      possibly chemotherapy. Because of the location of the salivary glands and
      surrounding delicate anatomic structures such as the facial
      nerve,&nbsp;removing tumors is a complex surgery that requires an
      experienced head and neck surgical oncologist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our surgeons take care to preserve the surrounding structures and
      nerves&nbsp;whenever possible, and to minimize any cosmetic or functional
      issues resulting from surgery.&nbsp;For each surgery, we take a
      personalized approach, taking into account the need to monitor these
      tumors in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="/specialties/cancer/programs/head-neck/Pages/treatment.aspx">
        Radiation therapy
      </a>{" "}
      is often used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that may remain. In
      rare cases when it is not possible to remove a tumor, salivary gland
      cancer may be treated with radiation alone. At UC San Diego Health, your
      care is overseen by radiation oncologists who specialize in head and neck
      cancers.

    <h2>About Salivary Gland Cancer</h2>
    <p>
      Salivary gland cancer begins in one of the many different glands that make
      saliva and release it into the mouth. Most cancers form in the parotid
      glands, just in front of the ear, but they can also be found in the
      sublingual glands (under the tongue), the submandibular glands (below the
      jawbone), or other small glands in the mouth, nose, and larynx. Most
      tumors in the salivary glands, however, are not cancerous.
    </p>
    <h3>Types of Salivary Gland Cancers</h3>
    <p>
      There are many types of salivary gland cancers, named according to the
      type of cell they resemble. They include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Mucoepidermoid carcinoma, the most common type of salivary gland cancer.
        It often&nbsp;starts in the parotid glands but can develop in others.
      </li>
      <li>Adenoid cystic carcinoma</li>
      <li>
        Many types of salivary gland adenocarcinomas, including acinic cell
        carcinoma, polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA), and others,
        some very rare
      </li>
      <li>Malignant mixed tumors</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Symptoms and Risks</h3>
    <p>
      Most symptoms of salivary gland cancer could also be caused by other
      conditions or by a benign tumor. They may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Lump, swelling, or pain that does not go away in the mouth, cheek, jaw
        or ear
      </li>
      <li>Facial numbness</li>
      <li>Muscle weakness on one side of the face</li>
      <li>Trouble swallowing or opening mouth widely</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Risk factors for salivary gland cancers are not well understood, but there
      are some correlations with a history of smoking or exposure to radiation
      or heavy metals. About two-thirds of these cancers occur in people age 55
      and over.
